### 2. **Navigation Responsiveness** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Navigation clicks might not work consistently
- **Solution**: Enhanced smooth scrolling with better error handling
- **Changes**:
  - Added retry mechanism for element detection
  - Improved mobile menu closing behavior
  - Better navbar height calculations
  - Added console warnings for debugging

### 3. **TryHackMe Badge Sizing** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: TryHackMe badge was too large and disproportionate
- **Solution**: Reduced size and improved styling
- **Changes**:
  - Changed from `max-w-sm` to `max-w-xs`
  - Reduced iframe height from 80px to 64px
  - Reduced iframe width from 280px to 240px
  - Simplified holographic effects

### 4. **Tech Stack Performance** ✅ OPTIMIZED
- **Problem**: Large tech stack grid might cause performance issues
- **Solution**: Optimized grid layout and image handling

  - Client-side form validation
  - Email format validation
  - Better error messages
  - Improved loading states
  - Network error handling

### 6. **Animation Performance** ✅ OPTIMIZED
- **Problem**: Some animations might cause layout shifts
- **Solution**: Optimized motion components
- **Changes**:
  - Reduced animation duration from 0.6s to 0.4s
  - Added `ease: "easeOut"` for smoother transitions
  - Better staggered animations with optimized delays

### 7. **Mobile Responsiveness** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Various mobile-specific issues
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive mobile optimizations
- **Changes**:
  - Improved touch targets (min 44px)
  - Better tap highlighting
  - Prevented horizontal scroll
  - Enhanced focus states for accessibility
  - Added GPU acceleration for better performance

### 8. **CSS Optimizations** ✅ ADDED
